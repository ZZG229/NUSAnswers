One of the most effective ways to prepare for examination is by practicing past-year papers, and this practice is highly observed amongst NUS students. However, the University does not mandate the provision of answers for said papers. Many students thus are uncertain whether they have done the papers correctly even after spending hours attempting them. Current alternatives are friends, seniors and the IVLE forum. Yet friends and seniors don’t always know the answers and IVLE forum can be too slow a medium. The question is also too module-specific for Google to help out.

This may be detrimental as they may replicate the same mistakes during the actual exam if they are not rectified promptly. As such, in order to help NUS students with their revision and learning, we are going to launch an app called NUSAnswers which aims to solve this problem.


### Mission

We hope to create an App where NUS students can look up on answers for past year papers and engage in peer discussions efficiently.

### Vision

We want to promote peer learning among students and inspire them to embrace collaborative teamwork that is very important in the real world. At the same time, we wish to boost students’ confidence in themselves through incentivization and encourage them to have better self-evaluation skills as they give each other feedbacks.
